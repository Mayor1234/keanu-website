          After appearing as a background player in a couple of television shows
          during the 1980s, actor Keanu Reeves side-stepped from the small
          screen onto the big screen, appearing in such films as Speed (1994)
          and The Matrix (1999). But before he became a global icon and a
          box-office star, he had to work his way up to the top.

          Yep, Reeves might be known for his roles in Bill & Tedâ€™s Excellent
          Adventure (1989), John Wick (2014), and Toy Story 4 (2019), but he has
          also appeared in lesser-known films too! These films have kept the
          actor in work for decades, and have allowed him to work across genres,
          from sci-fi and action movies, to horror, drama, and beyond.

          Taking it decade by decade, these are the list of all Keanu Reeves
          movies:
